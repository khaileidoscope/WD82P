    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <p>
      A <em>potager</em> is a french term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen
      garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted witht
      he vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the
      function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.

    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <p>
      Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and
      form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide
      food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance.
      Potagers can disguise their function of providing for home in a wide array
      of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the fomality
      of a knot garden.
