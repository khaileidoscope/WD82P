# Problem Solving Process

<!-- 90% Planning & Research --- 10% Coding -->

1. Understand the problem
2. Plan

   - Algorithm -> Pseudocode
   - Pseudocode:

     1. Kapag ang user ay nagtype ng number
     2. Mag create ng counter variable kung saan ilalagay natin ang value na zero
     3. Mag create pa ng isang variable na maghohold ng value na nilagay ni user
     4. Habang mas mababa ang counter variable kumpara sa numbero na ininput ni user, dagdagan ito ng isa.
     5. I-print ang value ng counter variable sa console.

     inputNumber = 5
     counter = 0

3. Divide and conquer

## Solving Fizz Buzz

    1. Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

    2. Plan
        - There's an input to collect the number from user.
        - The desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number that the user entered. But for number divisible by 3, print Fizz. And for numbers divisible by 5, print Buzz.
        And for numbers divisible by both, print FizzBuzz.
        - Pseudocode:
        1. When a user inputs a number
        2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
        3. If the current number is divisble by 3 then print "Fizz"
        4. If the current number is divisble by 3 then print "Buzz"
        5. If the current number is divisble by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
        6. Otherwise print the current number.

    3. Divide and conquer
